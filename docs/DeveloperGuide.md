## Design & implementation

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="350" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the application.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`RecipeIO`**  is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following five components:

* `UI` The UI of the App.
* `RecipeList`: The command executor and holder of data of the app.
* `InputParser`: Extracts information from the user input into the command line.
* `CommandValidator`: The command validator.
* `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

The `commands`package represents a collection of commands used by **`RecipeList`**.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/DeleteRecipe.png" width="800" />

### UI Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [UI.java](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/recipeio/ui/UI.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UIDiagram.png)

The `UI` has an class-level attribute `SEPARATOR`, which is a line of dashes that can be used in console output.

The `UI` the following methods
* `getUserInput` : asks the user for an input through the command line.
* `sayHi` (class-level): greets the user.
* `printInstructions` (class-level) : prints a list of accepted commands.
* `printInvalidCommandWarning` (class-level) : warns the user of an invalid command.
* `bye` (class-level) : bids farewell to the user.

How the component works:

* Upon starting of the app, `RecipeIO` will create an instance of the `UI` class.
* The instance will be asking the user for his or her input, via the `getUserInput` method.
* During the execution of the app, it will also give the user some console feedback.
  * For example, the `printInstructions` method is called when the user inputs `help`.


### RecipeList Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [RecipeList.java](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/recipeio/recipe/RecipeList.java)

![Structure of the RecipeList Component](images/RecipeListDiagram.png)

The `RecipeList` contains many `Recipe`s, which has attributes:
* `name` : String
* `cookTime` : int
* `calories` : int
* `allergies` : ArrayList<String>
* `mealCategory` : MealCategory
* `url` : String
* `dateAdded` : LocaleDate

How the component works:

* Upon `executeCommand` call, the `RecipeList` will identify the command given in the user input (e.g. `list`), 
* It will then call the corresponding `listRecipes()` method defined in `RecipeList`. 
* This `listRecipes()` method will first call the `isValidListCommand` method in `CommandValidator` class.
* If the command is valid, the `ListRecipeCommand.execute()` command is called. 
* The reason for such a structure is to allow for command validation *before* the real execution. A good example is the `find()` command. 
* Thus, `RecipeList` contains an intermediate method for each functionality (add, find, delete, so on) , and serves as a command validator.
  * **Note:** these methods have been omitted in the class diagram for brevity.
* In `add()` and `delete()`, the `saveRecipes()` method is called to save the recipeBook after the modification.


### InputParser Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [InputParser.java](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/recipeio/InputParser.java)

![Structure of the InputParser Component](images/InputParserDiagram.png)

The `InputParser` contains many static methods that are used to make sense of the user's input. Some important methods are:
* `parseCommand(userInput)` : String 
  * gets the command type from the user input. e.g. `add`, `delete`
* `parseDetails(userInput)` : String[] 
  * gets the parameters that the user gave in his or her input.
  * for example, if the user inputs `find kw pasta`, the method will return `["kw", "pasta"]`
* `parseMealCriteria(userInput)` : MealCategory
   * checks which meal category the user inputted.

How the component works:

* The `InputParser` methods are called during command validation (see next Section for `CommandValidator` implementation)


### CommandValidator Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [CommandValidator.java](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/recipeio/CommandValidator.java)

![Structure of the CommandValidator Component](images/CommandValidatorDiagram.png)

The `CommandValidator` contains many static methods that are used to validate the user's input. Some important methods are:
* `isValidAddCommand(userInput)` : boolean
* `isValidDetailCommand(userInput)` : boolean
* `isValidDeleteCommand(userInput)` : boolean
* `isValidFindCommand(userInput)` : boolean

For example the `isValidDeleteCommand` will return `false` if one of the following happens.
1. the user does not input an index to find. e.g. `delete`
2. the user's inputted index is not a integer. e.g. `delete abc`
3. the user inputs an index that is out of range. e.g. `delete -1`, or `delete 10` when there are only 3 recipes.

How the component works:

* The `CommandValidator` methods are called by methods in the `RecipeList` component to verify the user's input.
* Methods in `InputParser` are called to make sense of the user's input.


### Storage Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [Storage.java](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/recipeio/storage/Storage.java)

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageDiagram.png)

The `Storage` class handles the saving and loading of data file (i.e. the recipe book). Some important methods are:
* `saveFile(ArrayList<Recipe> recipeList))` : void
* `loadData()` : void

How the component works:

* Upon start up of `RecipeIO`, an instance of `Storage` is created, and the app attempts to read an existing data file via the `loadData()` method.
* If no file is found, the application will create one upon execution of `add` command.
* The `list`, `add`, and `delete` methods in `RecipeList` will call the `saveFile` method to write into the data file.

   * **Console output**: Suggests the user try another keyword or check the existing recipe names for exact matches.

3. **Test case**: `find kw`
   * **Expected**: No recipe is found due to the absence of a keyword.
   * **Console output**: Prompts the user to ensure two arguments are entered for the find command.

4. **Test case**: `find kw 1`
   * **Expected**: No recipe matches because the keyword is not alphabetical.
   * **Console output**: Reminds the user that the keyword should consist of alphabets only.

### Finding a Recipe by Date

## Appendix: Area of Improvement

1. **Having the CommandValidator return the parsed input, if the command is valid.**
   * `CommandValidator` evaluates the inputs from the user, but only returns a boolean value of whether the command is valid.
   * If the command is valid, there is an additional call to `InputParser` to get the inputs again.
   * **Recommendation**: The `CommandValidator` could return the input together if the command is valid, and `null` otherwise.
2. **Enabling `find` and `filter` with various inputs**
   * Currently, the find and filter only take in one searchable input. Expanding that to include multiple (eg `filter egg dairy`) could increase the potential use case of the app.
